# Composable Android App for EVAL-HCRWATCH4Z

This is an app for testing the [HCRWATCH4Z](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-hcrwatch4z.html)
smart watch. It will made fully using jetpack compose.

### Progress
The bluetooth low energy scanning part is almost ready, we have used basic composable functions
like lazy list. The most advanced composable so far is the [PullRefreshIndicator](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/pullrefresh/package-summary
) compose function. Because PullRefreshIndicator is experimental is likely to be changed in futures
commits.
