# Composable Android App for EVAL-HCRWATCH4Z
### Progress
The bluetooth low energy scanning part is almost ready, we have used basic composable functions
like lazy list. The most advanced composable so far is the [PullRefreshIndicator](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/pullrefresh/package-summary
) compose function. Because PullRefreshIndicator is experimental is likely to be changed in futures
commits.
